# BLAS1_C
## Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms
## Level 1
## Single Precision Complex Arithmetic
BLAS1_C, a C++ library which implements the Level 1 Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS), using single precision complex arithmetic.

The BLAS are a small core library of linear algebra utilities, which can be highly optimized for various architectures. Software that relies on the BLAS is thus highly portable, and will typically run very efficiently.

The Level 1 BLAS are primarily for use in vector operations. In certain cases, they may also be used to operate on the rows or columns of a two-dimensional array.

## Languages:
BLAS1_C is available in a C version and a C++ version and a FORTRAN90 version and a MATLAB version.
